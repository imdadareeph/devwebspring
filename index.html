<p>The DEVWEBis a Social networking Website which serves as an access point for Bloggers and anyone can create his profile, follow up other users who are  registered. It is based on MVC architecture and is mostly customizable. Besides following each other, users can upload audio files, raw documents to a limited size.

<a id="designing" class="anchor" href="#designing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designing</h3>

<p>All designs were self created and have been done using web learning. Some images and third pary JS have also been used. All will be updated in due time. Currently thats all.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact the developers. This was a very old code with no pattern. So do not complain about a bad way of doing it. Infact this was done during the learning phase of web application. A better version of it will be soon available which is done in Spring Hibernate JSF primefaces JQuery Mysql and some other Libraries.</p>
